# cookie-stand project

### For lab 6, I created 5 objects that render sales dashboard (sales table) for seattle, tokyo, dubai, paris and lima stores.

### The store is open from 0600 AM to 0700 PM and the dashboards shows the sales per hour in every store.

### The Rendered page for this lab can be found [here:](https://jjescandor.github.io/cookie-stand/)

### For this lab, lab #8, we were tasked to create a wireframe for Pat's Salmon cookie Store.

### This website is still under progress any styling input would be very much appreciated!
