# cookie-stand project

### For lab six, I created 5 objects that render sales dashboards for seattle, tokyo, dubai, paris and lima stores.

### The store is open from 0600 AM to 0700 PM and the dashboards shows the sales per hour in every store.

### The Rendered page for this lab can be found [here:](https://jjescandor.github.io/cookie-stand/sales.html)

### This website is still under progress any styling input would be very much appreciated!
